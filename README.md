# Playground for json-schema and RDF

This repo contains code and samples to experiment with attaching semantic metadata to
payloads exchanged via APIs.

For readability:

- all json files are serialized as yaml
- all RDF files are serialized as text/turtle
- all semantic assets to be harvested/published are in
  `assets/`; files outside this directory should be safely
  ignored by other entities and are either used for testing
  or for developing and validating what's in `assets/`

Asset documentation can be provided inside turtle files
and via makdown files (eg. to better describe each specific development
process).

```

## Development

This repository uses pre-commit to validate content.
An integrated testing environment to reproduce the CI pipeline
is available via docker-compose, which goes on thru a set of steps.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-test.yml up
```

## Tests

Generate assets in different formats

- yaml -> json
- ttl -> ntriple, rdf+xml, jsonld

Generate RDF from json-schema
